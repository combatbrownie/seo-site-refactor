<Project> 'Challenge1: SEO Site Refactor'

<Description> 
My client, Horiseon Marketing Agency requested a codebase that follows 
accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. 

<Methodology and Impact> 
After initially reviewing their source code, I identified 
each semantic html element with a comment and added necessary semantic html elements 
such as a footer, nav, section and main tags.  These elements provide a logical 
structure and flow to the codebase which is helpful to future developers and to search
engines that crawl the site.  

The codebase had several images that were missing alt descriptions, these descriptions were added to each image in the codebase.  
The result will increase accessibility of the site for readers that may not be 
able to view the images files on their devices and moreover, the alt 
additions will be received favorably by search engine crawlers which 
could lead to an increased SERP ranking and potentially increased traffic to the site.

The minor adjustments were made to the heading attributes so that they are sequentially 
ordered.  This event will benefit future developers of the codebase and is a favorable
signal to search engine web crawlers.

The title element was adjusted to reflect a consise and descriptive title 
relevant to the site and to web crawlers that may lead to an increased SERP ranking and 
more traffic to the site.

<Learning> I learned how to use Lighthouse (chrome inspect developer tool) to check the accessibility rating.  The accessibility rating is now over 95%. 
In addition, I learned that elements should follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
